# Oscarr the oscillator

Inspired by [Magpie Pedals' Beehive](https://www.magpiepedals.com/shop/product/the-beehive) and built on top of [Pizzicato.js](https://alemangui.github.io/pizzicato/), Oscarr the oscillator (OSCillating ARRay) is a drone instrument made of chewing gum, spaghetti code and outdated HTML tags. But it works. And it's fun. And I like to listen to it.

Play it. Have it play itself. Push buttons, move sliders, take the code from github, modify it however you like and make it your own.

## Building your own and making modifications
It's a one page, semi-structured melange of deprecated html, unscalable CSS and mostly unCamelCased JS. Do your worst.
